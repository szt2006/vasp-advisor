----

During angular-descriptor sparsification ({{TAG|ML_LSPARSDES}}=T), insignificant angular descriptors are removed based on a leverage scoring. The percentage of angular descriptors that are kept is determined by the value of {{TAG|ML_RDES_SPARSDES}}, which must be chosen between 0 < r \leq 1. In practice, we recommend scanning a range between 0.1 to 0.9. Removing angular descriptors increases the performance of a force field, but it decreases accuracy at the same time. One method of finding the optimal tradeoff between accuracy and performance is to do a Pareto front with run time on the x-axis and accuracy on the y-axis.
