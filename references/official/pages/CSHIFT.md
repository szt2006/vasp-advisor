{{DEF|CSHIFT|0.1| for {{TAG|LOPTICS}} |{{TAG|OMEGAMAX}}*1.3 / max({{TAG|NOMEGA}},40)| for GW calculations|0.1| for BSE calculations/Casida TDDFT calculations|0.1| for Time Evolution TDDFT calculations}}
Description: {{TAG|CSHIFT}} sets a Lorentzian broadening in eV of the dielectric tensor via the complex shift &eta; in the Kramers-Kronig transformation of the response function.
----
The default {{TAG|CSHIFT}}=0.1 is perfectly acceptable for most calculations and causes a slight smoothing of the real part of the dielectric function. If the gap is very small (i.e. approaching two times {{TAG|CSHIFT}}), slight inaccuracies in the static dielectric constant are possible, which can be remedied by decreasing {{TAG|CSHIFT}}. If {{TAG|CSHIFT}} is further decreased, it is strongly recommended to increase the frequency grid by setting {{TAG|NEDOS}} to values around 2000.
{{NB|mind|For the quartic-scaling GW algorithm, one should manually check that {{TAG|CSHIFT}} is at least as large as the grid spacing at low frequencies. If {{TAG|CSHIFT}} is smaller than the grid spacing, the QP energies might show erratic behavior (for instance large re-normalization factors Z).}}
