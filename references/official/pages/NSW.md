{{TAGDEF|NSW|[integer]|0}}

Description: {{TAG|NSW}} sets the maximum number of ionic steps.
----

{{TAG|IBRION}} = 0:
:{{TAG|NSW}} gives the number of steps in all molecular dynamics runs. It *has* to be supplied, otherwise VASP exits immediately after having started. We recommend splitting long MD runs containing ab-initio calculations into multiple calculations with {{TAG|NSW}}&lessapprox;20000. For {{TAG|ML_MODE}}=run larger values of {{TAG|NSW}} should be possible, but consider setting {{TAG|ML_OUTBLOCK}}.
{{TAG|IBRION}} != 0: 
:In all minimization algorithms (quasi-Newton, conjugate gradient, and damped molecular dynamics) {{TAG|NSW}} defines the maximum number of ionic steps.

Within each ionic step at most {{TAG|NELM}} electronic steps are performed. It is fewer if the convergence criterion set by {{TAG|EDIFF}} is met before. Forces and stresses are calculated according to the setting of {{TAG|ISIF}} for each ionic step.
