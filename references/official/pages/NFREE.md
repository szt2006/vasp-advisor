{{DEF|NFREE|1|if {{TAG|IBRION}}{{=}}2|0|else|}}

Description: depending on {{TAG|IBRION}}, {{TAG|NFREE}} specifies the number of remembered steps in the history of ionic convergence runs, or the number of ionic displacements in frozen phonon calculations.

*{{TAG|IBRION}}=1 (quasi-Newton algorithm for ionic relaxation):  

:(i) If  {{TAG|NFREE}} is set, only up to {{TAG|NFREE}} ionic steps are kept in the iteration history (the rank of the approximate Hessian matrix is not larger than {{TAG|NFREE}}).

:(ii) If {{TAG|NFREE}} is **not** specified, the criterion whether information is removed from the iteration history is based on the eigenvalue spectrum of the inverse Hessian matrix: if one eigenvalue of the inverse Hessian matrix is larger than 8, information from previous steps is discarded. 
:For complex problems {{TAG|NFREE}} can usually be set to a rather large value (i.e. 10-20), however systems of low dimensionality require a careful setting of {{TAG|NFREE}} (or preferably an exact  counting of the number of degrees of freedom). To increase {{TAG|NFREE}} beyond 20 rarely improves convergence. If {{TAG|NFREE}} is set to too large, the RMM-DIIS algorithm might diverge.

*{{TAG|IBRION}}=5 (from VASP.4.5) or {{TAG|IBRION}}=6 (from VASP.5.1): frozen phonon approach to calculate the zone-center vibrational frequencies of a system.
:{{TAG|NFREE}} determines how many displacements are used for each direction and ion. The step size has to be given in {{TAG|INCAR}}, by the tag {{TAG|POTIM}}.  Displacements should be small enough to ensure that the harmonic approximation is safely fulfilled.   If too large values are supplied in the input file, it is defaulted to 0.015 &Aring; up from VASP.5.1 (but *not* in all earlier releases). Expertise shows that this is a very reasonable compromise.

:{{TAG|NFREE}} = 2 uses central difference, *i.e* each ion is displaced in each direction by a small positive and negative displacement

::\pm {{TAG|POTIM}} * \hat{x}  ,  

::\pm {{TAG|POTIM}} * \hat{y}  ,

::\pm {{TAG|POTIM}} * \hat{z}  ,

:For {{TAG|NFREE}} = 4, four displacements are used

::\pm {{TAG|POTIM}} * \hat{x}   and \pm 2 * {{TAG|POTIM}} * \hat{x},

::\pm {{TAG|POTIM}} * \hat{y}   and \pm 2 * {{TAG|POTIM}} * \hat{x},

::\pm {{TAG|POTIM}} * \hat{z}   and \pm 2 * {{TAG|POTIM}} * \hat{x},

:For {{TAG|NFREE}}=1, only a single displacement is applied (it is strongly recommend to avoid {{TAG|NFREE}}=1).
