{{TAGDEF|NGYROMAG|[real array]|NTYP*1.0}}

Description: {{TAG|NGYROMAG}} specifies the nuclear gyromagnetic ratios (in MHz, for H0 = 1 T) for the atomic types on the {{FILE|POTCAR}} file. 
----
By means of the {{TAG|NGYROMAG}}-tag one can specify the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio:

 NGYROMAG = gamma_1  gamma_2 ... gamma_N

where one should specify one number for each of the *N* species on the {{FILE|POSCAR}} file, i.e. if C, H, N, and O are listed as species in the {{FILE|POSCAR}} file, then there should be four numbers in {{TAG|NGYROMAG}}, regardless of how many total atoms there are. 
{{NB|important|If one does not set {{TAG|NGYROMAG}} in the {{FILE|INCAR}} file, VASP assumes a factor of 1 for each species.}}

{{TAG|NGYROMAG}} is given in units of MHz/T, see Ref. {{Cite|gyromag:web}} for a table of different gyromagnetic ratios. A more extensive list is available on {{Cite|gyromag:database:web}} which converts isotopic magnetic moments from Ref. {{Cite|gyromag:book:2019}} and converts them using the definition of the gyromagnetic ratio defined in Ref. {{Cite|tiesinga:revmodphys:2021}}.
