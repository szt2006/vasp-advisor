{{TAGDEF|LAECHG|.TRUE. {{!}} .FALSE. |.FALSE.}}

Description: when {{TAG|LAECHG}}=.TRUE. the *all-electron* charge density will be reconstructed explicitly and written to files.
----
If {{TAG|LAECHG}}=.TRUE. is set VASP will reconstruct the *all-electron* charge density on the so-called "fine" FFT-grid.
This "fine" FFT-grid consists of {{TAG|NGXF}}&times;{{TAG|NGYF}}&times;{{TAG|NGZF}} points in real space (*i.e.*, the grid that is used to represent the augmented pseudo charge densities of the USPP and PAW methods).

In fact, for {{TAG|LAECHG}}=.TRUE., VASP will reconstruct three distinct *all-electron* densities:

# the core density.
# the proto-atomic valence density (overlapping atomic charge densities).
# the self-consistent valence density.

These are written to the files {{FILE|AECCAR0}}, {{FILE|AECCAR1}}, and {{FILE|AECCAR2}}, respectively.
The first two of these files are written at the start of the run, whereas the last is written at the end after self-consistency has been reached.

**N.B.:** In the language of the PAW method an "all-electron" density does **not** refer to the *density of all electrons*, instead it denotes a density that includes all the nodal features near the nucleus associated with the *true* (as opposed to the *pseudized*) one-electron orbitals.
Within the PAW method, the *all-electron* density arising from the one-electron pseudo orbitals \{ \widetilde{\psi}_{n\mathbf{k}} \} is given by:
:
n(\mathbf{r})=
\sum_{n{\mathbf{k}}} f_{n{\mathbf{k}}}
\langle \widetilde{\psi}_{n\mathbf{k}}| \mathbf{r}\rangle\langle  \mathbf{r}| \widetilde{\psi}_{n\mathbf{k}} \rangle +
\sum_{\alpha, \beta} 
(
  \phi^\ast_\alpha(\mathbf{r})
  \phi_\beta (\mathbf{r})
 -
  \widetilde{\phi}^\ast_\alpha(\mathbf{r})
  \widetilde{\phi}_\beta (\mathbf{r})
)
\sum_{n{\mathbf{k}}} f_{n{\mathbf{k}}}
\langle\widetilde{\psi}_{n\mathbf{k}}|\widetilde{p}_\alpha\rangle
\langle\widetilde{p}_\beta| \widetilde{\psi}_{n\mathbf{k}}\rangle

Normally one does not attempt to reconstruct *all-electron* densities explicitly since the second term on the right-hand side varies rapidly near the nuclei and is too costly to expand in-plane waves (see the bit about augmentation and compensation charges). For {{TAG|LAECHG}}=.TRUE., however, this reconstruction is exactly the thing that is done.
