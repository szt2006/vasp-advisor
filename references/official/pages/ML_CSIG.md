{{DISPLAYTITLE:ML_CSIG}}
{{TAGDEF|ML_CSIG|[real]|0.4}}

Description: Parameter used in the automatic determination of threshold {{TAG|ML_CTIFOR}} for error estimation in the machine learning force field method.
----
The usage of this tag in combination with the learning algorithms is described here: here.

The standard error of the history of maximum estimated errors of the forces ({{TAG|ML_MHIS}}) and it's slope must be below {{TAG|ML_CSIG}} and {{TAG|ML_CSLOPE}} so that an update of the threshold for the maximum estimated error of forces {{TAG|ML_CTIFOR}} can take place.
