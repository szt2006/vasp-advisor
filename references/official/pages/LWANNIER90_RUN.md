{{TAGDEF|LWANNIER90_RUN|.TRUE. {{!}} .FALSE.|.FALSE.}}

Description: {{TAG|LWANNIER90_RUN}} executes wannier_setup (see {{TAG|LWANNIER90}}=.TRUE.) and subsequently runs WANNIER90 (http://www.wannier.org) in library mode (wannier_run).
----
For details on the execution of wannier_setup in VASP, see the description of the {{TAG|LWANNIER90}}-tag.
For information on the many tags one may set in the {{FILE|wannier90.win}} file to control the execution of WANNIER90 (be it standalone or in library mode) we refer to the WANNIER90 manual (http://www.wannier.org/doc/user_guide.pdf).

**Mind**: when running WANNIER90 in library mode, the {{FILE|wannier90.mmn}} and {{FILE|wannier90.amn}} files are not written. The information these files normally contain is passed on to wannier_run internally. If you want these files to be written anyway, for instance to be able to run WANNIER90 standalone later on, one should add

 {{TAG|LWRITE_MMN_AMN}}=.TRUE.

to the {{FILE|INCAR}} file.
