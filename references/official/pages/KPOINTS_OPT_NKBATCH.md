{{DISPLAYTITLE:KPOINTS_OPT_NKBATCH}}
{{TAG| KPOINTS_OPT_NKBATCH}} = [integer]

Default: {{TAGDEF|KPOINTS_OPT_NKBATCH|Number of k-points in the irreducible Brillouin zone of the self-consistent calculation.}}

Description: {{TAG| KPOINTS_OPT_NKBATCH}} determines the size of the batch of k-points for the KPOINTS_OPT driver.
----

When the {{FILE|KPOINTS_OPT}} is present an additional non-self-consistent calculation is performed after self-consistency is reached.
This one-shot calculation is done in batches of N k-points to reduce memory usage.
Increasing the size of the batch leads to faster calculation times but higher memory usage in the non-self-consistent calculation.
