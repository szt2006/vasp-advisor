{{TAGDEF|LKPROJ|.TRUE. {{!}} .FALSE. | .FALSE.}}

Description: switches on the **k**-point projection scheme.
----
For {{TAG|LKPROJ}}=.TRUE., VASP will project the orbitals onto the reciprocal space of an alternative unit cell.
This unit cell has to be supplied in the file {{FILE|POSCAR.prim}}, in the usual {{FILE|POSCAR}} format.

As a first step, the **k**-projection scheme determines the set {**k&prime;**}, of **k**-points in the irreducible part of the first Brillouin zone of the structure given in {{FILE|POSCAR.prim}}, for which

:
\langle \mathbf{k}'+\mathbf{G}' | \mathbf{k}+\mathbf{G}\rangle \neq 0

where **G** and **G&prime;** are reciprocal space vectors in the reciprocal spaces of the structures specified in {{FILE|POSCAR}} and {{FILE|POSCAR.prim}}, respectively. As usual, the set of points {**k**} is specified in the {{FILE|KPOINTS}} file.
The set {**k&prime;**} is written to the {{FILE|OUTCAR}} file. Look at the part of the {{FILE|OUTCAR}} following NKPTS_PRIM. 

Once the set {**k&prime;**} has been determined VASP will compute the following

:
\Kappa_{n\mathbf{k}\sigma\mathbf{k}'}=\sum_{\mathbf{GG}'}
  \langle \mathbf{k}'+\mathbf{G}'| \mathbf{k}+\mathbf{G}\rangle
\langle \mathbf{k}+\mathbf{G} | \psi_{n\mathbf{k}\sigma}\rangle |^2

and writes this information onto the {{FILE|PRJCAR}} and {{FILE|vasprun.xml}} files.

Kn**k**&sigma;**k&prime;** provides a measure of how strongly the orbital \Psin**k**&sigma; contributes at the point **k&prime;** in the reciprocal space of structure {{FILE|POSCAR.prim}}.

One may, for instance, use this scheme to project the orbitals of a supercell onto the reciprocal space of a generating primitive cell.
{{NB|warning| At the moment the **k**-point projection only works with {{TAG|NPAR}}{{=}}1.}}
{{NB|mind| Available as of VASP version 6.0.0.}}
