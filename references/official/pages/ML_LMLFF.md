{{DISPLAYTITLE:ML_LMLFF}}
{{TAGDEF|ML_LMLFF|[logical]|.FALSE.}}

Description: Main control tag which enables/disables the use of machine learning force fields.
{{NB|mind|Machine learning force fields is available in {{VASP}} as of version 6.3.0}}
----
If {{TAG|ML_LMLFF}} = .FALSE. machine learning force fields are disabled and all related {{FILE|INCAR}} tags, i.e. all tags starting with "**ML_**", are ignored. If machine learning force fields are used by setting {{TAG|ML_LMLFF}} = .TRUE., the {{VASP}} mode of operation depends on the choice of {{TAG|ML_MODE}}. If {{TAG|ML_MODE}} is not supplied in the {{FILE|INCAR}} file then the default mode of operation is to run an MD simulation with on-the-fly machine learning, i.e., {{TAG|ML_MODE|train}}. This training is started "from scratch" if no {{FILE|ML_AB}} file is provided, otherwise a continuation run is performed.
