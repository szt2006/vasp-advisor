{{TAGDEF|BSEHOLE|[real array]}}

Description: {{TAG|BSEHOLE}} sets the coordinates of the fixed hole of the exciton wavefunction
----
If {{TAG|BSEHOLE}} is set in a BSE calculation, VASP computes exciton wavefunction for the first {{TAG|NBSEEIG}} states.
The coordinates are provided in direct (fractional) coordinates.

When fixing the position of the particle, ensure that it is not fixed exactly at the center of an atom or coincides with a node of the wavefunction. To avoid that, shift the fixed coordinate slightly away from the center of the atom. Furthermore, the wavefunction of the fixed particle is taken at the nearest \mathbf{G}-vector, whose exact position is written in the {{FILE|OUTCAR}} file 
 hole position is fixed at:
or
 electron position is fixed at:
