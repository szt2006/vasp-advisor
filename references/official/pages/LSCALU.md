{{TAGDEF|LSCALU|[logical]|.FALSE.}}

Description: {{TAG|LSCALU}} switches on the parallel LU decomposition (using scaLAPACK) in the orthonormalization of the wave functions. 

----

For {{TAG|LSCALU}}=.TRUE. the LU decomposition in the orthormalization of the wave functions is done in parallel, using scaLAPACK routines.
Provided, of course, {{TAG|LSCALAPACK}}=.TRUE. and VASP was compiled with scaLAPACK support (precompiler flag: -DscaLAPACK).

In many cases, the scaLAPACK LU decomposition based is *slower* than the serial LU decomposition (compare the timing ORTHCH in the respective {{FILE|OUTCAR}} files). Hence the default is {{TAG|LSCALU}}=.FALSE.
(subspace rotations, however, are still done using scaLAPACK).
