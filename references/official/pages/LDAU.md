{{TAGDEF|LDAU|.TRUE. {{!}} .FALSE.|.FALSE.}}

Description: {{TAG|LDAU}}=.TRUE. switches on DFT+U.
----

{{TAG|LDAU}} is the main control tag to switch on DFT+U. Check {{TAG|LDAUTYPE}} for an overview of the available methods. A typical setup in the INCAR file may include

  {{TAGBL|LDAU}}      = .TRUE.
  {{TAGBL|LDAUTYPE}}  = 2 
  {{TAGBL|LDAUL}}     = 2 -1      # l quantum number where U is added for each atom; -1 is no U added
  {{TAGBL|LDAUU}}     = 7.00 0.00 # on-site Coulomb interaction (in eV) for each atom 
  {{TAGBL|LDAUJ}}     = 1.00 0.00 # on-site exchange interaction (in eV) for each atom
  {{TAGBL|LMAXMIX}}   = 4

**Note on band-structure calculation**: The {{FILE|CHGCAR}} file contains only information up to angular momentum quantum number l={{TAG|LMAXMIX}} for the on-site PAW occupancy matrices. When the {{FILE|CHGCAR}} file is read and kept fixed in the course of the calculations ({{TAG|ICHARG}}=11), the results will necessarily be not identical to a self-consistent run. The deviations are often large for DFT+U calculations. For the calculation of band structures within the DFT+U approach, it is hence strictly required to increase {{TAG|LMAXMIX}} to 4 (d elements) and 6 (f elements).
