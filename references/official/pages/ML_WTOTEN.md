Description: Sets a scaling of the fitted potential energy. 
----

For {{TAG|ML_IWEIGHT}}=2 and 3 (default), the potential energy in the training data set is multiplied by {{TAG|ML_WTOTEN}} (unitless). We recommend increasing {{TAG|ML_WTOTEN}} if you plan to apply the force field in a simulation where the accuracy of the total energy is most important. This puts a focus on the energy error and is desirable, for instance, for the computation of defect-formation energies.

For {{TAG|ML_IWEIGHT}}=1, {{TAG|ML_WTOTEN}} has the unit of eV/atom, and the potential energy in the training data set is divided by it.
