Description: Controls whether the Debye-Waller contribution is included in the calculation of the phonon-induced electron self-energy.
{{Available|6.5.0}}

----

The phonon-induced electron self-energy has two contributions at second order in perturbation theory, the Fan-Migdal self-energy and the real-valued Debye-Waller self-energy.
{{TAG|ELPH_SELFEN_DW}} controls the computation of the latter, while the former can be computed via {{TAG|ELPH_SELFEN_FAN}}.

The result is reported individually for each self-energy accumulator in the {{FILE|vaspout.h5}} file as

/results/electron_phonon/electrons/self_energy_1/selfen_dw

{{NB|mind|The Debye-Waller self-energy is computed using the rigid-ion approximation{{cite|giustino:rmp:2017}}.}}
