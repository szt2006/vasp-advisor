{{TAGDEF|QUAD_EFG|[real array]|NTYP*1.0}}

Description: nuclear quadrupole moment (in millbarn) for the atomic types on the {{FILE|POTCAR}} file.
----
Setting the {{TAG|QUAD_EFG}} tag allows the conversion of the *V*zz (see {{TAG|LEFG}}) values into the quadrupole coupling constants *C*q often encountered in NMR literature.
The conversion formula is as follows (*Q* is the element and isotope specific quadrupole moment):
:
C_q = \frac{e Q V_{zz}}{h}.

{{NB|tip|Several definitions of  C_q are used in the NMR community.}}
The {{TAG|QUAD_EFG}} tag specifies the nuclear quadrupole moment in millibarns for each atomic species, in the same
order as in the {{FILE|POTCAR}} file. The output *C*q is in MHz. An online compilation of nuclear quadrupole moments can be found online in a database {{Cite|pyykko:web}} or in Ref. {{Cite|pyykko:molphys:2008}} (updated numbers in Ref. {{Cite|pyykko:molphys:2017}}).

Suppose a solid contains Al, C, and Si, then the {{TAG|QUAD_EFG}} tag could read:

 QUAD_EFG = 146.6 33.27 0.0

27Al is the stable isotope of Al with a natural abundance of 100% and *Q*=146.6.
The stable isotopes 12C and 13C are not quadrupolar nuclei, however, the radioactive
11C is. It has *Q*=33.27. For Si, all stable isotopes have I≤1/2, making it redundant to calculate a *C*q. No moments are known for the other isotopes.
{{NB|important|For heavy nuclei inaccuracies are to be expected because of an incomplete treatment of relativistic effects.}}
