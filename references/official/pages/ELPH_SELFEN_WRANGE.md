{{DISPLAYTITLE:ELPH_SELFEN_WRANGE}}
{{TAGDEF|ELPH_SELFEN_WRANGE|[real]|0}}

Description: Together with {{TAG|ELPH_SELFEN_NW}} specifies the energy window in which to evaluate the phonon-induced electron self-energy.
{{Available|6.5.0}}

----

The electron self-energy, \Sigma_{n \mathbf{k}}(\omega), depends on the frequency \omega (or energy \hbar \omega).
The tag {{TAG|ELPH_SELFEN_WRANGE}} determines the width of the energy window in which to evaluate the self-energy.
However, the location and width of the energy window is also influenced by the sign of {{TAG|ELPH_SELFEN_NW}}.
For more information, we refer to the documentation of {{TAG|ELPH_SELFEN_NW}}.
