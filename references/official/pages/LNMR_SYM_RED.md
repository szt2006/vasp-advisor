{{TAGDEF|LNMR_SYM_RED| .TRUE. {{!}} .FALSE. | .FALSE.}}

Description: discard symmetry operations that are not consistent with the way *k*-space derivatives are calculated in the linear-response calculations of chemical shifts.
----

The star on which the *k*-space derivative is calculated is oriented along the cartesian directions in *k* space. If the symmetry operations in *k* space do not map this star onto itself, erroneous results can be obtained. To check for such operations, set {{TAG|LNMR_SYM_RED}}=.TRUE.. VASP then disregards such operations, and the resulting first Brillouin zone (IBZ) is larger. This is only relevant if the use of symmetry is switched on, i.e. {{TAG|ISYM|0|op=>}}. In case of any doubt, set {{TAG|LNMR_SYM_RED}}=.TRUE. 
{{NB|warning|It matters how the real-space-lattice vectors are set up relative to the cartesian coordinates in the {{FILE|POSCAR}} file.}} It determines the orientation of the *k*-space star and, hence, can affect the efficiency via the number of *k*-points in the IBZ.
