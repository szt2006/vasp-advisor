{{TAGDEF|NBANDSGW|[integer]| twice the number of occupied states}}

Description: The flag determines how many QP energies are calculated and updated in GW type calculations. 

----

This value usually needs to be increased somewhat for partially or fully self-consistent calculations. Very accurate results
are only obtained when {{TAG|NBANDSGW}} approaches {{TAG|NBANDS}}, although this  dramatically increases the computational requirements.
