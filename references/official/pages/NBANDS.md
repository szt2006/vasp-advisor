N_{\mathrm{elect}} is {{TAG|NELECT}} and N_{\mathrm{ions}} is the number of ions (NIONS in {{FILE|OUTCAR}}).

Description: {{TAG|NBANDS}} specifies the total number of KS or QP orbitals in the calculation.

The right choice of {{TAG|NBANDS}} strongly depends on the type of the performed calculation and the system. As a minimum, VASP requires all occupied states + one empty band, otherwise, a warning is given. 
#### Electronic minimization
In the electronic minimization calculations, empty states do not contribute to the total energy, however, empty states are required to achieve a better convergence. 
In iterative matrix-diagonalization algorithms (see {{TAG|ALGO}}) eigenvectors close to the top of the calculated number of states converge much slower than the lowest eigenstates, thus it is important to choose a sufficiently large {{TAG|NBANDS}}.  Therefore, we recommend using the default settings for {{TAG|NBANDS}}, i.e.,  *NELECT/2 + NIONS/2*, which is a safe choice in most cases. In some cases, it is also possible to decrease it to *NELECT/2+NIONS/4*, however, in some transition metals with open *f* shells a much larger number of empty bands might be required (up to *NELECT/2+2*NIONS*).  To check this parameter perform several calculations for a fixed potential ({{TAG|ICHARG}}=12) with an increasing number of bands (e.g. starting from *NELECT/2 + NIONS/2*). An accuracy of  10^{-6} should be obtained in 10-15 iterations. 
{{NB|tip|Note that the {{TAG|RMM-DIIS}} scheme ({{TAG|ALGO}}{{=}}Fast) is more sensitive to the number of bands than the default Davidson algorithm ({{TAG|ALGO}}{{=}}Normal) and can require more bands for fast convergence.|}}
#### Many-body perturbation theory calculations
In the Many-Body Perturbation Theory calculations (*GW*,RPA, and BSE), a large number of empty orbitals is usually required, which can be much higher than the number of occupied states.  The convergence of the calculations with a large number of empty states can be very slow. In such cases, we recommend performing an exact diagonalization ({{TAG|ALGO}}=Exact) of the Hamiltonian with empty bands starting from a converged charge density.
#### Parallelization
When executed on multiple CPUs, VASP automatically increases the number of bands, so that {{TAG|NBANDS}} is divisible by the number of CPU cores.  If {{TAG|NCORE}} > 1, {{TAG|NBANDS}} is increased until it is divisible by the number of cores in a group ({{TAG|NCORE}}).  If {{TAG|KPAR}} > 1, {{TAG|NBANDS}} is increased until it is divisible by the number of cores in a group. 
#### Spin-polarized calculation
In the case of spin-polarized calculations, the default value for {{TAG|NBANDS}} is increased to account for the initial magnetic moments.
#### Noncollinear calculation
In noncollinear calculations, the default {{TAG|NBANDS}} value is doubled to account for the spinors components.
