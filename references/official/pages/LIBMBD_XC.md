Default: The functional set by the {{TAG|GGA}}, {{TAG|METAGGA}} or {{TAG|XC}} tag

Description: {{TAG|LIBMBD_XC}} sets the exchange-correlation functional for the setting of damping parameters used in the methods available in the library libMBD of many-body dispersion methods{{cite|libmbd_1}}{{cite|libmbd_2}}{{cite|hermann:jcp:2023}}.
----
{{TAG|LIBMBD_XC}} allows to choose the exchange-correlation functional that determines which set of damping parameters is used in the methods available in the library libMBD of many-body dispersion methods. The value is internally passed to the libMBD input **xc** described at the page {{cite|libmbd_input}}.

The possible choices depend on the dispersion method selected with the {{TAG|LIBMBD_METHOD}} tag and are listed in the file mbd_damping.F90 of the libMBD source code. If {{TAG|LIBMBD_XC}}=none is chosen, then no set of damping parameters is selected and either {{TAG|LIBMBD_TS_SR}} or {{TAG|LIBMBD_MBD_BETA}} has to be set.
{{NB|important| This feature is available from VASP.6.4.3 onwards that needs to be compiled with -DLIBMBD.}}
libMBD is a separate library package that has to be downloaded{{cite|libmbd_2}} and compiled before VASP is compiled with the corresponding precompiler options and links to the libraries.
