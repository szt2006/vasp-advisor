Description: Allows specifying an alternative primitive cell for the mapping of the electron-phonon potential.
{{Available|6.5.0}}

----

Once the electron-phonon potential has been computed in the supercell, it needs to be mapped to the primitive cell.
This is done via {{TAG|ELPH_POT_GENERATE|True}}.
By default, VASP performs the mapping for the primitive cell that is found by the symmetry routines and that is reported in the {{FILE|OUTCAR}} file.
In cases where the primitive cell needs to be specified manually, {{TAG|ELPH_POT_LATTICE}} can be used.

{{TAG|ELPH_POT_LATTICE|a1x a1y a1z a2x a2y a2z a3x a3y a3z}} specifies the three primitive lattice vectors \mathbf{a}_1, \mathbf{a}_2 and \mathbf{a}_3 in Cartesian coordinates.
These lattice vectors are then used to construct the primitive-cell information in the {{FILE|phelel_params.hdf5}} file.
{{NB|mind|The supplied lattice vectors must span a valid primitive cell of the supercell or the code will exit with an error.}}
{{NB|tip|The primitive cell used for mapping is also written to the {{FILE|CONTCAR_ELPH}} file, which can conveniently be used as the {{FILE|POSCAR}} input for the subsequent electron-phonon calculation. This ensures that the primitive-cell calculation is consistent with the information in the {{FILE|phelel_params.hdf5}} file.}}
