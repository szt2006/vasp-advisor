{{TAGDEF|LMAXMIX|[integer]|2}}

Description: {{TAG|LMAXMIX}} controls up to which *l*-quantum number the one-center PAW charge densities are passed through the charge density mixer and written to the {{FILE|CHGCAR}} file.
----
Higher *l*-quantum numbers (*l*>{{TAG|LMAXMIX}}) are not handled by the density mixer (these components of the one-center charge density are set to the value corresponding to the present orbitals). Usually, it is not necessary to increase {{TAG|LMAXMIX}}, but the following cases are exceptions:

*DFT+U calculations require, in many cases, an increase of {{TAG|LMAXMIX}} to 4 for *d*-electrons (or 6 for *f*-elements) to obtain fast convergence to the ground state.

*The {{FILE|CHGCAR}} file will contain the one-center PAW occupancy matrices up to {{TAG|LMAXMIX}}. When the {{FILE|CHGCAR}} file is read and kept fixed in the course of the calculations ({{TAG|ICHARG}}=11), the results will not necessarily be identical to a self-consistent run. The deviations will be large for DFT+U calculations. For the calculation of band structures within the DFT+U approach, it is strictly required to increase {{TAG|LMAXMIX}} to 4 for *d*-elements and to 6 for *f*-elements.

*SDFT calculations that consider noncollinear magnetism often require slow mixing of the spin density up to 4 for *d*-elements and up to 6 for *f*-elements to obtain fast convergence to the ground state.
