{{DEF|ML_SIGW0|1E-7|for {{TAG|ML_MODE}} {{=}} REFIT|1.0|else}}

Description: This flag sets the precision parameter s_{\mathrm{w}} (see here for definition) for the fitting in the machine learning force field method. 
----
The default value for {{TAG|ML_MODE}}=*REFIT* works reliably in most calculations, however, sometimes it is necessary to increase the regularization parameter to avoid instabilities during finite temperature molecular dynamics simulations.

Suppose the regularization needs to be controlled manually, like e.g. in the fitting via singular value decomposition ({{TAG|ML_MODE}}=*REFIT* or {{TAG|ML_IALGO_LINREG}}=4). The best is to control the regularization via this parameter and keep the noise parameter s_{\mathrm{v}} (see {{TAG|ML_SIGV0}}) constant at 1. Useful values for {{TAG|ML_SIGW0}} are typically between 1E-1 and 1E-9. When the value is increased the regularization is increased. This often slightly increases the training set error but also reduces potential instabilities. Hence, if instabilities are observed during molecular-dynamics simulations, one should try to increase {{TAG|ML_SIGW0}} to say 1E-3, then refit, and repeat the molecular-dynamics simulations.   

More on the theory of this regularization parameter can be found in this section.
