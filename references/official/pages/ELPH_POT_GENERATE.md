Description: Calculates the electron-phonon potential from finite atomic displacements.
{{Available|6.5.0}}
----

Performing electron-phonon calculations using  many-body perturbation theory requires as input a {{FILE|phelel_params.hdf5}} file.
Setting {{TAG|ELPH_POT_GENERATE|True}} provides a way to generate the {{FILE|phelel_params.hdf5}} file directly in VASP by  computing the electron-phonon potential.
This is accomplished by using finite atomic displacements in a supercell.
Therefore, in addition to setting {{TAG|ELPH_POT_GENERATE|True}}, it is necessary to set {{TAG|IBRION|6}} to activate the finite-difference routines.
{{NB|mind|We currently do not support all symmetry operations when considering the atomic displacements for {{TAG|ELPH_POT_GENERATE|True}}. Therefore, more atomic displacements are generated compared to typical finite-difference calculations using {{TAG|IBRION|6}}.}}

When {{TAG|ELPH_POT_GENERATE|True}}, VASP will additionally produce the {{FILE|CONTCAR_ELPH}} file.
This file contains the primitive-cell crystal structure in the {{FILE|POSCAR}} format and can directly be used as input for the subsequent electron-phonon calculation.
The primitive cell is automatically determined by VASP during the supercell calculation, but can optionally be specified via the {{TAG|ELPH_POT_LATTICE}} tag.

Finally, the electron-phonon potential in the {{FILE|phelel_params.hdf5}} file is computed on a real-space FFT grid that has to match exactly the FFT grid dimensions ({{TAG|NGX}}, {{TAG|NGY}}, {{TAG|NGZ}}) of the primitive cell used in the subsequent electron-phonon calculation.
The dimensions of the FFT grid used to compute the electron-phonon potential can be chosen via the {{TAG|ELPH_POT_FFT_MESH}} tag.
If one does not specify an FFT grid explicitly, VASP will determine the FFT grid dimensions automatically based on the current {{TAG|ENCUT}}.
This should produce an FFT mesh for the electron-phonon potential that is compatible with the FFT mesh used in a primitive-cell calculation at the same {{TAG|ENCUT}}.
{{NB|tip|The {{TAG|PREC}} {{FILE|INCAR}} tag influences the size of the FFT mesh. Therefore, it is recommended to choose the same {{TAG|PREC}} for both the supercell as well as the primitive-cell calculation.}}

Basic information about the primitive-cell geometry and FFT grid is written to the {{FILE|OUTCAR}} file in the following format:

 Generation of phelel_params.hdf5

Primitive cell 
   a1 =     1.78093078    1.78093078    0.00000000
   a2 =     0.00000000    1.78093078    1.78093078
   a3 =     1.78093078    0.00000000    1.78093078

Primitive FFT mesh =     18    18    18

It is also written to the machine-readable {{FILE|vaspout.h5}} file at the following HDF5 paths:

results/elph_potential/primitive_positions
results/elph_potential/primitive_fft_mesh

This information is already contained within the generated {{FILE|phelel_params.hdf5}} file.
However, it is mirrored in the standard output to make it easier for users to check their calculations and to automate workflows.
