Description: Determines if the stress tensor is calculated and which ionic degrees of freedom are varied.
----

For {{TAG|ISIF}}\ge2, the stress tensor is calculated. It is defined as the negative of the derivative of the energy
  E  with respect to the strain tensor \eta_{ji}:

:  \sigma_{ij} = - \frac{\delta E} {\delta \eta_{ji}} .

This might be different from other first principles codes.
A positive in the diagonals means that the system is under compressive strain and wants to expand. A negative value implies that the system is under tensile strain and wants to reduce its volume. The stress tensor is symmetric \sigma_{ij}=\sigma_{ji}, and, thus, it has six independent entries. 
The calculation of the stress tensor is relatively time-consuming, and, therefore, by default, it is switched off in some cases (e.g., hybrid functionals). The forces are always calculated.
{{NB|tip|You can get information about the stress at each ionic step using {{TAG|NWRITE|0,1,2,3}}.}}

{{TAG|ISIF}} also determines which degrees of freedom (ionic positions, cell volume, and cell shape) of the structure are allowed to change.

* For {{TAG|ISIF|1}}, only the trace of the stress tensor is calculated. This means only the total pressure is correct and can be read off in the line:

 external pressure =      ... kB

:The individual components of the stress tensor are not reliable in this case and must be disregarded.
* Accuracy
{{NB|warning|The PAW basis for the electronic minimization is not adjusted when the structure is varied during a calculation.|:}} 
:Therefore, carefully consider effects such as Pulay stress and choose generous settings for the electronic minimization. Generally, volume changes should be done only with an increased energy cutoff, e.g., {{TAG|ENCUT|1.3&times;max({{TAG|ENMAX}})}}, and {{TAG|PREC|High}}.
* To further control the ionic degrees of freedom that can vary during the calculation, set Selective dynamics in the {{FILE|POSCAR}} file. 
* {{TAG|ISIF|8}} is only available as of VASP.6.4.1.
