Description: Tag to control the minimum interval to get training samples in the machine learning force field method.

The usage of this tag in combination with the learning algorithms is described here: here

This tag defines a lower threshold for taking new configurations from the MD, so that as long as the upper threshold for the Bayesian error (e.g. {{TAG|ML_CDOUB}} times {{TAG|ML_CTIFOR}}) is not exceeded,  at least {{TAG|ML_NMDINT}} MD steps are preformed using the MLFF (i.e. no first principles calculation is performed). This avoids that many nearly identical structures are added.
