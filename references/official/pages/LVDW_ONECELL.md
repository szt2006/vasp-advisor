{{TAGDEF|LVDW_ONECELL|[logical][logical][logical]| .FALSE. .FALSE. .FALSE. }} 

Description: {{TAGDEF|LVDW_ONECELL}} can be used to disable vdW interaction with mirror image in X Y Z direction. This is advisable for molecular calculations in the gas phase. In all other cases, use the default.

Note: There is some confusing documentation on the ASE pages, which states that ".TRUE. .TRUE. .TRUE." enables the interaction with neighboring cells. However, the opposite is the case and *.TRUE.* disables the interaction (".FALSE. .FALSE. .FALSE." = interactions switched on, ".TRUE. .TRUE. .TRUE." = interactions switched off).
