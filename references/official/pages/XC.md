Description: Specifies a combination of exchange-correlation functionals.
----
A combination of semilocal (LDA, GGA, and METAGGA) functionals can be set with the {{TAG|XC}} tag, which provides much more flexibility in the choice of the functional compared to the {{TAG|GGA}} and {{TAG|METAGGA}} tags. The functionals that can be combined are the functionals implemented in VASP (listed at {{TAG|GGA}} and {{TAG|METAGGA}}) and the functionals implemented in Libxc{{cite|marques:cpc:2012}}{{cite|lehtola:sx:2018}}{{cite|tran:arxiv:2026}}{{cite|libxc}} (listed on the Libxc website{{cite|libxc_list}}). The combination can consist of up to 100 components; for each, a multiplication factor can be set with the {{TAG|XC_C}} tag.
{{NB|mind|This tag is available since VASP.6.4.3.}}
## Examples of {{FILE|INCAR}}
*50% of PBE{{cite|perdew:prl:1996}} and 50% of PBEsol{{cite|perdew:prl:2008}}
 {{TAG|XC}} = PE PS
 {{TAG|XC_C}} = 0.5 0.5

*SCAN exchange{{cite|sun:prl:15}} combined with PBE correlation{{cite|perdew:prl:1996}}
 {{TAG|XC}} = SCAN_X PBE_C

*70% of B88{{cite|becke:pra:1988}} (from Libxc) and 30% of PBE{{cite|perdew:prl:1996}} for exchange and 100% of LYP (from Libxc) for correlation{{cite|lee:prb:1988}} 
 {{TAG|XC}} = GGA_X_B88 PBE_X GGA_C_LYP
 {{TAG|XC_C}} = 0.7 0.3 1.0

*15% of HF, 63.75% of PBE{{cite|perdew:prl:1996}}, and 21.25% of B88{{cite|becke:pra:1988}} (from Libxc) for exchange and 75% of PBE{{cite|perdew:prl:1996}} and 25% of LYP{{cite|lee:prb:1988}} (from Libxc) for correlation
 {{TAG|LHFCALC}} = .TRUE.
 {{TAG|XC}}      = PE GGA_X_B88 GGA_C_LYP
 {{TAG|XC_C}}    = 0.75 0.25 0.25
 {{TAG|AEXX}}    = 0.15
 {{TAG|AGGAX}}   = 0.85

:The PBE exchange is multiplied by 0.75\times0.85=0.6375 and the B88 exchange by 0.25\times0.85=0.2125.

*15% of HF, 63.75% of PBE{{cite|perdew:prl:1996}}, and 21.25% of SCAN{{cite|sun:prl:15}} for exchange and 75% of PBE{{cite|perdew:prl:1996}} and 25% of SCAN{{cite|sun:prl:15}} for correlation
 {{TAG|LHFCALC}} = .TRUE.
 {{TAG|XC}}      = PE SCAN
 {{TAG|XC_C}}    = 0.75 0.25
 {{TAG|AEXX}}    = 0.15
 {{TAG|AGGAX}}   = 0.85
 {{TAG|AMGGAX}}  = 0.85

:The PBE exchange is multiplied by 0.75\times0.85=0.6375 and the SCAN exchange by 0.25\times0.85=0.2125. {{TAG|AGGAX}} and {{TAG|AMGGAX}} multiply the exchange part of PBE and SCAN, respectively.
