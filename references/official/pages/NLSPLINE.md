{{TAGDEF|NLSPLINE|.TRUE. {{!}} .FALSE. | .FALSE.}}

Description: construct the PAW projectors in reciprocal space using spline interpolation so that they are *k*-differentiable.
----
For {{TAG|NLSPLINE}}=.TRUE., the PAW projectors in reciprocal space ({{TAG|LREAL}}=.FALSE.) are set up using a spline interpolation so that they are *k* differentiable. This improves the susceptibility contribution to the chemical shifts. It only slightly affects the other contributions to the chemical shifts.

It is advised to set {{TAG|NLSPLINE}}=.TRUE. if and only if PAW projectors are applied in reciprocal space and chemical shifts are calculated, i.e., if and only if {{TAG|LREAL}}=.FALSE. and {{TAG|LCHIMAG}}=.TRUE. As this option also gives slightly different total energies, it is advised to use the default {{TAG|NLSPLINE}}=.FALSE. in all other calculations for reasons of compatibility.

Real-space projectors are *k* differentiable by construction, hence do not require to set {{TAG|NLSPLINE}}=.TRUE.
